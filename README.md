# SeattleTempPredict_RandomForest
A simple implementation of a random forest to predict Seattle's Temperature for the next day. 

This is a toy project (*still in-progress*) that uses using 25 years worth of single station data (Seattle-Tacoma Airport, KSEA) to train and test a simple ML model using weather information from the prior two days.

Data is from the [NOAA Climate Data Online tool](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/)
